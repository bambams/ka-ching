The name ka-ching isn't set in stone yet. I just needed /something/ to
name the directory and repository. I'm not completely satisfied with it so
I expect I'll change it if I can think of something clever or more
sensible.

I want a CLI interface to manage a budget and figured that I would write
one. I've only just begun thinking about it though so I'm not really clear
of where it's going to go.

I'm beginning with Perl because it's a fast language to "hack" away in and
I rather enjoy it. I'm sure it will suffice and will probably make many
tasks easier, but the language isn't set in stone so I may end up using
more or porting completely to a different language if I feel inclined to
do so.

I intend for the CLI to be similar to Git in that there will be many
programs with specific purposes (adding expense items, adding payments,
adding incomes, etc.) and the end result is hopefully very modular and
clean.

Assume GPLv2+, though I haven't gotten around to adding licensing yet
(since I only just mkdir'd).
