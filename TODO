# After rushing into some implementation details I've decided that if I
# want any chance of writing something useful that I had better stop and
# think before I code. :P My plan is to use a SQLite database and so I
# think my very first order of business is going to be the schema. Once
# I have that figured out I should have a better idea of how the data
# will be stored and what the UIs will need to be to interact with the
# data. Then I can fill in the blanks. These are just some rough plans to
# help keep me motivated. xD

* Design schema.
  - Identify data entities.
  - Identify relationships between them.
  - Research budgets and account sheets online for inspiration...
* Design UI.
  - Determine the necessary operations and which commands they will
    correspond to.
  - Determine which options each command should support.
* Implement the guts of the program. The logic and data handling.
  - Figure out how the data entities interact and how best to use them.
  - Figure out how to maintain sufficient precision in both Perl and in
    the SQLite database.
* Figure out configuration options.
  - Example: Negative format:  -number  vs.  (number)
